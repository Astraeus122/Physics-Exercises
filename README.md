## Requirements
- **Visual Studio 2019** (v142 toolset or later, 2022, is the compiler used to make this project)
- **SFML Version 2.6.2**
- Supported OS: **Windows 10/11**

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Astraeus122/Physics-Exercises.git
    cd gd2p02-physics-exercises
    ```
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Configure the solution to use the `Release` or `Debug` build settings.
4. Build and run the desired sub-exercise.

## Usage
To run a specific sub-exercise:
1. Navigate to the `Exercise###` folder.
2. Open the corresponding `.vcxproj` file in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project and run it.

Alternatively, precompiled builds are available in the `Release` folders of each sub-exercise.
